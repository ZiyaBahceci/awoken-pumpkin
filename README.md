This is a Unity 2D game made for school project in 2019. I've done the design and testing part of this project. Backend development of this project was done by Halis Bilal Kara and all art was done by OÄŸuzhan Kalkuz.

This game is practically a Plants and Zombies type game with different art and design.

Menus:The game has a standard main menu with play-options-quit buttons and an options menu where the player can change the audio and difficulty.

Gameplay: The game has 5 levels each harder than previous in enemy spawn amounts and frequency. The currency of the game is wheat. There are 4 types of items a player can buy and spawn: Plantable wheat that generates 50 wheat every once and then, Muskeeter which is a standard rifleman, Melee farmer which is weaker and only deals damage in point blank range and Mage who is the strongest character with most DPS and range. There are 3 enemies: Zombkin (a standard zombie), Ghosty (a floating ghost) and Hound (a purple hound). All attack only with melee. Goal of the game is basically to not run out of wheat, spawn defenders correctly to fend off attackers and keep them away from the farm. If the player loses all lives, game is over. If the player completes all levels, they get the credit screen, and return to main menu.
